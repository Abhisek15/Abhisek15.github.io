The journey of life came March 17th, 1997. That was the day my parents blessed me with the name Abhisek Malakar. The path my life has taken so far has been a steady one with very few times that I&’ve gone off course. 
<br>
I look at my life as a gift and try my hardest not to take it for granted. The years I have spent on this earth have been more than amazing and I imagine they are more than I could have ever asked for. I spend the majority of my time with the ones I love most, like my family and friends.
<br> They are the ones that keep my head on straight and help me succeed at the goals I set for myself. If it weren’t for the people who love me the most and the fortunate home I have grown up in I don’t know where in the world I would be today. 
<br>
As I said before, I spend most of my hours with my family and friends. My family is my strength and wisdom and backbone.
<br>
 My best friends are my two sisters and they are the ones that help me in hard times and hold me up when I need the extra support. That is why I consider them my “backbone”.
<br>
It’s obvious that my family and friends mean more than anything to me but there are other things in my life that I have a deep passion for. These things include football ,basketball, and my ambition to succeed in life.  My goal is to be a successful,  when I move beyond my own home.
<br>
Currently i Study in IIT kharagpur and aspire to become a true engineer. 
<br><br><br>
That’s my life in a nut-shell but if you want to know more about the real me continue on throughout this website!
