Throughout my experience at high school I have learned and expanded my knowledge on many different subjects.This ranges anywhere from math and science,to English and history- but where I have learned the most is in computers and technology. 
<br>
I have broaden my horizons when it comes to learning about software programs and the millions of free useful resources you can find on the internet. 
<br>
I haved learnt languages like C, C++,Java.I also know HTML and CSS. I have also learnt Adobe Photoshop CS6 which is one of the best photo editting software. Now i am currently learning Javascript. </p>
