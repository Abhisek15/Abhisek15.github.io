<h2>
A Brother
</h2>
<p>
I have two sister that means everything to me.  I look up to my sisters when times are tough and I know that she always comes to me when she is struggling in life. We are more then just sisters, we are best friends. My sister is always there for me and I give her the same support in return. Me and her are like two pees in a pod. Sometimes we have our differences, but without a doubt we get over it quickly.

<h2>
A Student
</h2>
<p>
One of the most important aspects of creating a good life for yourself is that you are a good student. I feel that I am as good as a student as anyone can be. I have this drive during school that is like no other. I set goals for myself like completing all work, tests, and projects to the best of my ability. I think this ambition comes from the fact that I want to be as successful as my sisters were during their high school career. Being an overall hardworking student is what I strive for. I feel that if i get this than I can get to any plan I plan for.
</p>
<h2>
A Friend
</h2>
<p>
In order for people to befriend you, you have to be friendly yourself. I have some of the greatest friends I could ever ask for.  I try to be the greatest friend I can to everyone I meet. In order to do this I set all judgements aside and be as nice as I would expect someone to be to me. You always hear your parents saying "Treat others the way you want to be treated." and "Don't say anything, if you don't have anything nice to say at all." I really try to follow these two things so that people can look at me whenever they do need a friend.
